# R-scripts

#### Each folder in this repo contains the r scripts and data necessary to recreate the analysis for
#### EdBuild's project of the same name. For many of the scripts, you will need to install edbuildr and
#### edbuildmapr.

#### You can fork these projects to recreate the analsysis for another year, or change the methodology
#### for a new analysis.
